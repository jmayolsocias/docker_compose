My name is Jaume, 40 years old and I'm from Spain.

I started my IT career as Network Engineer but in 2015 I decided to have a career change and I moved into DevOps.

Since then, I have been working on public clouds (mainly AWS) and also on-premise datacenters.

I have experience in provisioning infrastructure with terraform and cloudformation, automation with Ansible, CI/CD in Jenkins, Spinnaker and CircleCI, ECS, Kubernetes, monitoring with nagios, Kibana and Datadog.

I consider myself a team player, contributing to the team in order to complete tasks and being reliable.
